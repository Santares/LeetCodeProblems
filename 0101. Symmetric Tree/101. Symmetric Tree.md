### [101\. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


Given the `root` of a binary tree, _check whether it is a mirror of itself_ (i.e., symmetric around its center).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/symtree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?

#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        
```
