Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `nums.length == n + 1`
*   `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.

**Follow up:**

*   How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
*   Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums)-1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i+1]:
                return nums[i]
        
```
