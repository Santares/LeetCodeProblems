In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1.  The town judge trusts nobody.
2.  Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3.  There is exactly one person that satisfies properties **1** and **2**.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>]` representing that the person labeled `a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>` trusts the person labeled `b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`.

Return _the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return_ `-1` _otherwise_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 1000`
*   `0 <= trust.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `trust[i].length == 2`
*   All the pairs of `trust` are **unique**.
*   `a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> != b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>`
*   `1 <= a<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub>, b<sub style="display: inline;">i</sub> <= n`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findJudge(self, n: int, trust: List[List[int]]) -> int:        
        people = [-1] + [0] * n
        for a, b in trust:
            people[b] += 1
            people[a] -= 1
            
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if people[i] == n-1:
                return i
        
        return -1
```
