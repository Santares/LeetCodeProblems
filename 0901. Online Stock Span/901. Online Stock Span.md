Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day.

The **span** of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.

*   For example, if the price of a stock over the next `7` days were `[100,80,60,70,60,75,85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1,1,1,2,1,4,6]`.

Implement the `StockSpanner` class:

*   `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.
*   `int next(int price)` Returns the **span** of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]

Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= price <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   At most `10<sup>4</sup>` calls will be made to `next`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class StockSpanner:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.record = {}

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        res = 1
        l = len(self.stack) - 1
        while l >= 0:
            x = self.stack[l]
            if x <= price:
                res += self.record[l]
                l -= self.record[l]
            else:
                break
        self.stack.append(price)
        self.record[len(self.stack) - 1] = res
        
        return res
        
        


# Your StockSpanner object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = StockSpanner()
# param_1 = obj.next(price)
```
