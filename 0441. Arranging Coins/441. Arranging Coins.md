You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i<sup>th</sup>` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

Given the integer `n`, return _the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        
```
