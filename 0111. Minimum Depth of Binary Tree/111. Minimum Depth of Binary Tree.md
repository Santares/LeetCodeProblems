### [111\. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Difficulty: **Easy**  

Related Topics: [Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/tree/), [Depth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/depth-first-search/), [Breadth-First Search](https://leetcode.com/tag/breadth-first-search/), [Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/tag/binary-tree/)


Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>5</sup>]`.
*   `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```
