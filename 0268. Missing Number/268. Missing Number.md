Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return _the only number in the range that is missing from the array._

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `n == nums.length`
*   `1 <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
*   All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        base = nums[0]

        if nums[0] != 0:
            return 0
        if nums[-1] != base + len(nums):
            return base + len(nums)


        while left < right:
            mid = right + (left - right) // 2
            if nums[mid] == base + mid:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] > base + mid:
                right = mid

        return left
    
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
    n = len(nums)
    return n * (n+1) / 2 - sum(nums)
```
