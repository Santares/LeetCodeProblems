The between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the sum of **Hamming distances** between all the pairs of the integers in_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,14,2]
Output: 6
Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case).
The answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,14,4]
Output: 4
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`
*   The answer for the given input will fit in a **32-bit** integer.
