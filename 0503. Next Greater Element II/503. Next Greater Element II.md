Given a circular integer array `nums` (i.e., the next element of `nums[nums.length - 1]` is `nums[0]`), return _the **next greater number** for every element in_ `nums`.

The **next greater number** of a number `x` is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, return `-1` for this number.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2; 
The number 2 can't find next greater number. 
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,3]
Output: [2,3,4,-1,4]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElements(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        queue = []
        l = len(nums)
        res = [-1] * len(nums) * 2
        
        nums += nums
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            x = nums[i]
            while queue:
                if x > queue[-1][0]:
                    res[queue[-1][1]] = x
                    queue.pop()
                else:
                    break
            queue.append([x, i])
        
        return res[:l]
```
