You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

*   For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num1tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/num2tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
*   `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
*   The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumNumbers(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def goDeep(nums, root):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            nums.append(root.val)
            if root.left is None and root.right is None:
                res = 0
                size = len(nums)
                for i, v in enumerate(nums):
                    res += v * 10**(size - i - 1)
                return res
            else:
                return goDeep(list(nums), root.left) + goDeep(list(nums), root.right)
            
        return goDeep([], root)
```
