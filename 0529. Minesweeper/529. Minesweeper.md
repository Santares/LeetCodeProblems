Let's play the minesweeper game (, )!

You are given an `m x n` char matrix `board` representing the game board where:

*   `'M'` represents an unrevealed mine,
*   `'E'` represents an unrevealed empty square,
*   `'B'` represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines (i.e., above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals),
*   digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and
*   `'X'` represents a revealed mine.

You are also given an integer array `click` where `click = [click<sub style="display: inline;">r</sub>, click<sub style="display: inline;">c</sub>]` represents the next click position among all the unrevealed squares (`'M'` or `'E'`).

Return _the board after revealing this position according to the following rules_:

1.  If a mine `'M'` is revealed, then the game is over. You should change it to `'X'`.
2.  If an empty square `'E'` with no adjacent mines is revealed, then change it to a revealed blank `'B'` and all of its adjacent unrevealed squares should be revealed recursively.
3.  If an empty square `'E'` with at least one adjacent mine is revealed, then change it to a digit (`'1'` to `'8'`) representing the number of adjacent mines.
4.  Return the board when no more squares will be revealed.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_1.png)

```
Input: board = [["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","M","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"],["E","E","E","E","E"]], click = [3,0]
Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/minesweeper_example_2.png)

```
Input: board = [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","M","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]], click = [1,2]
Output: [["B","1","E","1","B"],["B","1","X","1","B"],["B","1","1","1","B"],["B","B","B","B","B"]]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `m == board.length`
*   `n == board[i].length`
*   `1 <= m, n <= 50`
*   `board[i][j]` is either `'M'`, `'E'`, `'B'`, or a digit from `'1'` to `'8'`.
*   `click.length == 2`
*   `0 <= click<sub style="display: inline;">r</sub> < m`
*   `0 <= click<sub style="display: inline;">c</sub> < n`
*   `board[click<sub style="display: inline;">r</sub>][click<sub style="display: inline;">c</sub>]` is either `'M'` or `'E'`.
