Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1.  Search for a node to remove.
2.  If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del_node_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3\. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

*   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   Each node has a **unique** value.
*   `root` is a valid binary search tree.
*   `-10<sup>5</sup> <= key <= 10<sup>5</sup>`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
