Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array with `O(1)` extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
*   `s[i]` is a .


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        return s[::-1]
        
```
