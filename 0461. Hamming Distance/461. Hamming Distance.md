The between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return _the **Hamming distance** between them_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

*   `0 <= x, y <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**
