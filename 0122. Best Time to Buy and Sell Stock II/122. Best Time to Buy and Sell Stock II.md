You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i<sup>th</sup>` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold **at most one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the **same day**.

Find and return _the **maximum** profit you can achieve_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
```

**Constraints:**

*   `1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
*   `0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>`


#### Solution

Language: **Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) <= 1:
            return 0
        
        totalProfit = 0
        profit = 0

        buy = prices[0]
        sell = prices[0]

        for i in range(len(prices)):
            x = prices[i]
            # if x < minPrice:
            #     totalProfit += sell - buy
            #     minPrice = x
            #     sell = x
            if x > sell:
                sell = x
            else:
                totalProfit += sell - buy
                buy = x
                sell = x
                
        totalProfit += sell - buy
                

        return totalProfit
                totalProfit += sell - buy
```
